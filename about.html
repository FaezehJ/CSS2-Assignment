    <h3>Main Characteristics</h3>

    <p>Budgies are among the most popular birds in the world and probably
        also the bird species most widely kept as a pet bird.</p>

    <h3>Distribution and Habitat</h3>

    <p>In the wild, budgies live together in large swarms in bushy areas and savannahs.
        They prefer eucalyptus trees.</p>

        <h3>Anatomy and Appearance</h3>
        <h4>Colors</h4>
        
        <p>heir plumage shows transverse black markings, which are rather delicate on the
           head and back and are becoming increasingly wider towards the wings. They're green
           by nature, but today there are the most diverse color variants from yellow,
           yellow/green to white and blue.
           Head Budgies can rotate their head by 180 degrees. This helps them in the wild to look
           in all directions in order to detect birds of prey early enough. You can watch them
           rotate their head by 180 degrees when they're going to sleep. They puff themselves up
           und then turn their head to hide it under one of their wings. By the way: They have an
           upper, a lower, and an inner lid to protect the birdâ€™s eye.</p>
